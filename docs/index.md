## 🚀 Overview

**ChemUnited** provides a user-friendly, visual interface for designing and executing complex lab automation 
workflows. It enables researchers, chemists, and automation engineers to construct, simulate, and monitor experiments through
an intuitive GUI without writing extensive code.

This project is ideal for controlling platform chemistry setups, especially when real-time interaction and visual protocol
design are needed.

## 🧠 Features

- 🎛️ **Visual Process Builder**: Drag-and-drop UI to define processes, modules, and steps.
- 🔗 **Connection Graphs**: Manage and visualize physical and logical device connections.
- ⚙️ **Protocol Execution Engine**: Run and monitor experiments in real time.
- 📈 **Timeline Monitoring**: See process evolution and status updates at every stage.
- 🧬 **FlowChem Integration**: Deep integration with [FlowChem](https://github.com/flowchem/flowchem)
to control physical hardware.
- 💡 **Modular Architecture**: Built using PyQt with pluggable component support.
